# Brain Tumor Classification

This project implements a deep learning model for brain tumor detection and classification using PyTorch. The model achieves high accuracy in identifying and categorizing brain tumors from medical imaging data.

## Project Overview

- **Initial Model**: A PyTorch-based model achieving 97% accuracy in brain tumor detection and classification.
- **Enhanced Model**: Fine-tuned using a Hugging Face model, reaching 99% accuracy.

## Features

- Detects the presence of brain tumors in medical images
- Classifies tumors into specific types
- Utilizes transfer learning for improved performance
- High accuracy (99%) after fine-tuning

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- transformers (for Hugging Face models)
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- (Add any other libraries you've used)
