# Brain Tumor Classifier Deployment

Welcome to our Streamlit app for deploying our trained model that classifies brain tumor images into four distinct categories!

## About the Model
Our model leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques using PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks. It has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of brain MRI scans, achieving an exceptional accuracy of 95% in classifying tumors into four types: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary tumors, and No Tumor.

## Dataset Preparation
This app also features tools for preprocessing and enhancing MRI images:
- Organizing and filtering MRI scans
- Enhancing image quality and resolution
- Ensuring uniformity and relevance of dataset samples

## Model Training
Our model's training process involved:
- Preprocessing MRI scans to extract relevant features
- Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate tumor classification
- Fine-tuning model parameters for optimal performance

The rigorous training, coupled with a robust dataset preparation, ensures reliable performance in tumor classification.

## Model Deployment
You can now utilize our trained model within this Streamlit app. Simply upload an MRI scan image, and the model will predict the tumor type accurately.

### Tumor Types:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary**

### Instructions:
1. Upload an MRI scan image using the file uploader.
2. View the predicted tumor type along with the confidence score.

Explore and experience the seamless deployment of our brain tumor classifier!
